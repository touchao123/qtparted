      <strong>Q: What is QTParted ?</strong><br></br>
      A: QTParted is an attempt to create a linux-based clone of Partition Magic.
      Actually, a clone already exists called "parted".  It allows the creation,
      reorganization, and removal of partitions. But "parted" has a command line based
      interface, which can be difficult for a newbie to use.<br/>
      However the developer of "parted" decided to separate the core of the program from its
      interface. So the program "parted" is actually a simple command line UI to libparted.
      Libparted is the core that actually does the partition editing.  QTParted is a GUI
      created around libparted written in QT (hence the name... QT + Parted  = QTParted).

      <strong>Q: Why is it called QTParted and not KParted ?</strong><br></br>
       A: Simple, because a program called KParted already exists, but it is not
       being developed actively. But I want to thank Richard Moore, the author of
       KParted.  Even if KParted is no longer being developed, I have been able
       to use parts of the source code (see qp_listview.h for details). To make
       things even more complicated, I had originally called my program KPiem,
       and some parts have not been changed to reflect the new name.

    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Is QTParted safe to use?</strong><br></br>
       A: I haven't had any problems using it...  but remember that
       you use QTParted at your own risk!
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Is it safe the release 0.4-beta?</strong><br></br>
       A: Yes, you can use it... i think that it is stable as the 0.3.X,
       however there are again some thing to fix, this is the reason why
       i call it "beta".

    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: The Resize/Move dialog suck !</strong><br></br>
       A: The new resize/move dialog is just an early implementation
       (consider it just a prototype)... that's all.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: QTParted doens't compile.</strong><br></br>
       A: If you want to build QTParted you must have libparted installed and running,
       the header of that library, and the full SDK of QT. Make sure that you set the
       QTDIR and QMAKESPEC environment variable to the correct values.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: What filesystems does QTParted support?</strong><br></br>
       A: More or less anything that "parted" supports.  See the "parted" homepage
       for more information.
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: My libparted doesn't support reiserfs</strong><br></br>
       A: Just compile and install progsreiserfs >= 3.0.4, after that (re)compile
       and (re)install libparted!
    </span>
  </p>

      <strong>Q: I need to handle NTFS</strong><br></br>
       A: From 0.1.6 i added the resize of ntfs.
    </span>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: QTParted crash when i try to use it.</strong><br></br>
       A: From 0.1.5 i solved a lot of segmentation fault that happens
       using g++ 3.2. However if you experience some problems please report to me.
    </span>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: QTParted doesn't show any partition on my device.</strong><br></br>
       A: Maybe the partition table doesn't exist! You can create a new
       partition table right clicking on the device... of course be aware
       what you're going to do! :)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: When will your release a usable version of QTParted?</strong><br></br>
       A: I already have :)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: When you release a new version?</strong><br></br>
       A: QTParted is just an hobby. I develop it during weekend or late night,
       'cause at work i cannot use Linux :(<br/>
       So please don't blame me if a lot of work must be done to finish QTParted
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Could you add the "xyz" function?</strong><br></br>
       A: I suggest you to add missing feature by yourself and send me a patch! ;)
	Actually i love feedback, if you want to suggest me something email me it,
	if i found that you suggest me a good thing i'll add it... to the "TODO" list :)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: It seems that QTParted doesn't manage msdos labels,
      also in the create dialog.</strong><br></br>
       A: It's true! I'll solve it, but be patience!
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Why not make something like a "batch" mode in which you make
      all changes and then you commit all at the end pressing an "aply" button?</strong><br></br>
       A: I added this feature in the 0.4-beta1... but... read below! :)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: When i hit the "save/commit" button i get "Error
      commiting device... please read the FAQ... /etc /etc". What about this?</strong><br></br>
       A: I know... this is a problem :( I don't want to blame kernel developers, but this
       is not a bug 	of qtparted, but a kernel bug! I think that even if a device is busy
       'cause there is mounted a partition you must be able to re-read partition table...
       kernel developers don't think so :( I will work for some kind of work around, but
       i cannot do miracles, even if i solve some problems you will not be able to use the
       full power of QTParted! A solution is to use qtparted on a live distribution, see
       the links page for more info!

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Where can i download rpm, tgz, deb, tricktrack of QTParted?</strong><br></br>
       A: Officially i'll upload in my pages only source .tar.gz and Debian SID package,
       for other kind of distribution see links page. I plan to add also rpm for
       SuSE 8.2 when i will release 0.4.
    </span>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Does it exist an italian/french/german/etc etc translation ?</strong><br></br>
       A: From version 0.1.7 i added localization in Italian... some user of QTParted
       already made some other localization (see AUTHORS file). If you want to translate
       QTParted in a new language just download and install linguist (provide with QT Sdk)
       and make a new ts. After that just send me your internationalization and i'll include
       in the next version!
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: Will be made a Windows release of QTParted?</strong><br></br>
       A: It is not possible. QTParted is just a GUI... you can compile it using
       QT under Windows, but the problem is that libparted is platform dependent.
       However you can use some kind of live distribution ;)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span xml:lang='en'>
      <strong>Q: There is a way to use QTParted without installing Linux ?</strong><br></br>
       A: A solution could be to include QTParted in a distribution with
       live filesystem, for example Knoppix, or SystemRescueCd.
